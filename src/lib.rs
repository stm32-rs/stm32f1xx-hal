//! # HAL for the STM32F1 family of microcontrollers
//!
//! This is an implementation of the [`embedded-hal`] traits for the STM32F1 family of
//! microcontrollers.
//!
//! [`embedded-hal`]: https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ## Building an application (binary crate)
//!
//! Follow the [cortex-m-quickstart] instructions, add this crate as a dependency
//! and make sure you enable the "rt" Cargo feature of this crate. Also select which
//! microcontroller you will be using by using the corresponding feature. The currently
//! supported microcontrollers are:
//!
//! - stm32f103
//! - stm32f100
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! This crate supports multiple microcontrollers in the
//! stm32f1 family. Which specific microcontroller you want to build for has to be
//! specified with a feature, for example `stm32f103`.
//!
//! If no microcontroller is specified, the crate will not compile.
//!
//! The currently supported variants are
//!
//! - `stm32f100`
//! - `stm32f101`
//! - `stm32f103`
//!
//! You may also need to specify the density of the device with `medium`, `high` or `xl` 
//! to enable certain peripherals. Generally the density can be determined by the 2nd character 
//! after the number in the device name (i.e. For STM32F103C6U, the 6 indicates a low-density
//! device) but check the datasheet or CubeMX to be sure.
//! * 4, 6 => low density, no feature required
//! * 8, B => `medium` feature
//! * C, D, E => `high` feature
//! * F, G => `xl` feature
//!
//!

//!
//! ## Usage example
//!
//! The following example blinks an LED connected to PC13 which is where the LED is connected on the
//! [blue_pill] board. If you are testing on a different breakout board, you may need
//! to change the pin accordingly.
//!
//!
//! ```rust
//! #![no_std]
//! #![no_main]
//! 
//! use panic_halt as _;
//! 
//! use nb::block;
//! 
//! use stm32f1xx_hal::{
//!     prelude::*,
//!     pac,
//!     timer::Timer,
//! };
//! use cortex_m_rt::entry;
//! use embedded_hal::digital::v2::OutputPin;
//! 
//! #[entry]
//! fn main() -> ! {
//!     // Get access to the core peripherals from the cortex-m crate
//!     let cp = cortex_m::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
//!     // Get access to the device specific peripherals from the peripheral access crate
//!     let dp = pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
//! 
//!     // Take ownership over the raw flash and rcc devices and convert them into the corresponding
//!     // HAL structs
//!     let mut flash = dp.FLASH.constrain();
//!     let mut rcc = dp.RCC.constrain();
//! 
//!     // Freeze the configuration of all the clocks in the system and store the frozen frequencies in
//!     // `clocks`
//!     let clocks = rcc.cfgr.freeze(&mut flash.acr);
//! 
//!     // Acquire the GPIOC peripheral
//!     let mut gpioc = dp.GPIOC.split(&mut rcc.apb2);
//! 
//!     // Configure gpio C pin 13 as a push-pull output. The `crh` register is passed to the function
//!     // in order to configure the port. For pins 0-7, crl should be passed instead.
//!     let mut led = gpioc.pc13.into_push_pull_output(&mut gpioc.crh);
//!     // Configure the syst timer to trigger an update every second
//!     let mut timer = Timer::syst(cp.SYST, &clocks).start_count_down(1.hz());
//! 
//!     // Wait for the timer to trigger an update and change the state of the LED
//!     loop {
//!         block!(timer.wait()).unwrap();
//!         led.set_high().unwrap();
//!         block!(timer.wait()).unwrap();
//!         led.set_low().unwrap();
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

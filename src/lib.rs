//! # HAL for the STM32F1 family of microcontrollers
//!
//! This is an implementation of the [`embedded-hal`] traits for the STM32F1 family of
//! microcontrollers.
//!
//! [`embedded-hal`]: https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ## Building an application (binary crate)
//!
//! A detailed usage guide can be found in the [README]
//!
//! supported microcontrollers are:
//!
//! - stm32f103
//! - stm32f101
//! - stm32f100
//! - stm32f105
//! - stm32f107
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! This crate supports multiple microcontrollers in the
//! stm32f1 family. Which specific microcontroller you want to build for has to be
//! specified with a feature, for example `stm32f103`.
//!
//! If no microcontroller is specified, the crate will not compile.
//!
//! The currently supported variants are
//!
//! - `stm32f100`
//! - `stm32f101`
//! - `stm32f103`
//! - `stm32f105`
//! - `stm32f107`
//!
//! You may also need to specify the density of the device with `medium`, `high` or `xl`
//! to enable certain peripherals. Generally the density can be determined by the 2nd character
//! after the number in the device name (i.e. For STM32F103C6U, the 6 indicates a low-density
//! device) but check the datasheet or CubeMX to be sure.
//! * 4, 6 => low density, no feature required
//! * 8, B => `medium` feature
//! * C, D, E => `high` feature
//! * F, G => `xl` feature
//!
//! ## Commonly used setup
//! Almost all peripherals require references to some registers in `RCC` and `AFIO`. The following
//! code shows how to set up those registers
//!
//! ```rust
//! // Get access to the device specific peripherals from the peripheral access crate
//! let dp = pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
//!
//! // Take ownership over the raw flash and rcc devices and convert them into the corresponding
//! // HAL structs
//! let mut flash = dp.FLASH.constrain();
//! let mut rcc = dp.RCC.constrain();
//!
//! // Freeze the configuration of all the clocks in the system and store the frozen frequencies in
//! // `clocks`
//! let clocks = rcc.cfgr.freeze(&mut flash.acr);
//!
//! // Prepare the alternate function I/O registers
//! let mut afio = dp.AFIO.constrain(&mut rcc.apb2);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Usage examples
//!
//! See the [examples] folder.
//!
//! Most of the examples require the following additional dependencies
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! embedded-hal = "0.2.3"
//! nb = "0.1.2"
//! cortex-m = "0.6.2"
//! cortex-m-rt = "0.6.11"
//! # Panic behaviour, see https://crates.io/keywords/panic-impl for alternatives
//! panic-halt = "0.2.0"
//! ```
//!
